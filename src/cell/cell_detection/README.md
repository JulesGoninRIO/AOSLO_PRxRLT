# Cell Detection Algorithms

Cell Detection is handle by two different algorithms, one using deep-learning and that works in eccentricities out of the very center of the eye (called Davidson's [MDRNN](./mdrnn/README.pdf), with Neural Style Transfer as preprocessing [NST](./nst/README.pdf)) and the other using adaptive thresholding that works in the very center of the eye (called Tsarytsin's [ATMS](./atms/README.pdf)). The latter has been developed by one of the HOJG intern (Mikhail Tsarytsin). Please have a look in the specific Readme's for more details.
